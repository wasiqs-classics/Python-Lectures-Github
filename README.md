Introduction
============

Hello Visitor! Assalam o Alaikum. 

This **GitHub Repo** is aimed to be a beginner friendly resource for anyone who want to learn Python and apply the learning in any in-demand skill like Data Science, Machine Learning, Generative AI or Automation (the list continues). This repo only assumes you know basic computing and have already installed Python. If you haven't install I recommend you to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nU2Egc3Zx3Q).

The contents of this course are designed to serve the following purposes:

1.  Introduction to Programming using Python - as it is one of the easiest languages to begin with.
    
2.  To learn and explore Python as a choice for Programming Language (of the future) considering its widescale uses in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning or as a General Purpose Programming Language to create applications.
    
3.  Should be able to create / do some realistic project(s) using Python. This could be a desktop GUI application, a web based application (backend) or Data Science / AI Related Project.

About me
============
I am Wasiq Khan, a lifelong learner and tech person. I simply love to teach what I know. So let's do amazing things together!  

## NOTE

**This repo will keep on updating, so star it, keep coming back and follow along as I put on new material each day.**

By the end of next 3 - 4 months, so you will see yourself a different person in Python Insha'Allah!

Oh yes! Share this with your friends. After 100 stars I will start video lectures as well on my YouTube Channel.
